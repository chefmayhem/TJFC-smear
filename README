README for TJFC-separated-smear

This is a version of the TJFC code designed to smear the signal and the 
background with their own systematic errors, and it also has the capability 
to maintain a minimum expected number of events independent of the signal 
and background components, used for uncertainty purposes.

I have decided, in order to keep the code simple, to remove the profile 
likelihood code from this version.  The profile likelihood code was (as of 
07-13-10) last really updated in the base TJFC class.  All the other 
variations are based on the non-Profile-Likelihood method.

The smear method is easier to understand than profile likelihood, so that's 
what I'm trying to implement for the T2K 1st summer analysis.

As always, this only works for a single bin, so forget multi-bin fits!

This method should be equivalent to what the MINOS group did for their 
nue appearance analysis except:

I'm using a full Poisson likelihood ratio, instead of a smaller one which is 
derived by using Sterling's approximation.  I did this because Sterling's 
approximation is not valid at small integers.

The MINOS group (at least Ochoa's thesis) assumed that the minimum possible 
number of expected events would come from the theta13 = 0 position on the 
dcp-q13 plot.  This is not necessarily true.

The MINOS group calculated, rather than a likelihood ratio, a 
delta-chi-square-critical, and used that to determine which values of n 
would be allowed in the 90% CL region.  This is exactly equivalent to the 
smearing method used.

The delta-chi-square-critical, rather than being calculated using a smeared 
Poisson distribution, is actually calculated through MC methods.  I prefer the 
numerical calculation of a smeared poissson likelihood, because it is faster 
computationally and less susciptible to fluctuations.  On the downside, it is 
a bit harder to explain to people.
